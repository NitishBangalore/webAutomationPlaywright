Here's a sample README file that you can use for your Playwright automation framework for MyBillBook web application. You can customize it further based on your specific requirements.

# MyBillBook Automation Framework

This repository contains an automation framework built with Playwright and JavaScript for automating tests on the **MyBillBook** web application. The framework is designed to facilitate end-to-end testing of MyBillBook's user interface and ensure the correct functionality of key features.

## Features

- **Automated UI Tests**: Automates end-to-end workflows on MyBillBook web application.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports running tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
- **Parallel Execution**: Can run tests in parallel to speed up execution.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Supports running tests with different sets of data.
- **Screen Capture & Videos**: Captures screenshots and videos on test failure to assist with debugging.
- **Allure Reports**: Generates detailed reports with test results, including pass/fail status, execution time, and screenshots.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the automation framework, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to get the framework up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mybillbook-automation-framework.git
   cd mybillbook-automation-framework
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the necessary npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**:

   Playwright needs the supported browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) to run the tests. Install them by running:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Configuration

The framework provides a configuration file (`config.js`) where you can customize various settings such as browser choice, base URL, and parallel execution.

- **baseURL**: The URL of the MyBillBook web application that will be used for all tests.
- **browser**: Default browser for running tests (`chromium`, `firefox`, or `webkit`).
- **headless**: Set to `true` to run tests in headless mode (no UI) or `false` to run in non-headless mode (visible UI).

Example configuration (`config.js`):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  baseURL: 'https://app.mybillbook.in',
  browser: 'chromium', // can be 'chromium', 'firefox', or 'webkit'
  headless: true, // set to false for non-headless mode
  screenshotOnFailure: true,
  videoOnFailure: true,
  reportPath: './test-reports'
};
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, follow these steps:

1. **Run all tests**:

   You can run all tests in the `tests` directory with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Run tests in a specific browser**:

   You can specify the browser by setting the `BROWSER` environment variable:

   ```bash
   BROWSER=firefox npm test
   ```

3. **Run tests in parallel**:

   By default, Playwright runs tests sequentially. However, you can run them in parallel by using Playwright's `projects` configuration in the test runner. You can adjust the number of workers in the configuration to run tests faster.

   Example of running tests in parallel:

   ```bash
   npm run test:parallel
   ```

## Test Structure

The framework is organized as follows:

```
mybillbook-automation-framework/
├── config.js                # Framework configuration file
├── tests/                   # Contains all the test files
│   ├── login.spec.js        # Test for login functionality
│   ├── dashboard.spec.js    # Test for dashboard functionality
│   ├── invoice.spec.js      # Test for invoice functionality
│   └── ...
├── utils/                   # Utility functions for common actions (e.g., login, setup)
│   ├── helper.js            # Helper functions
├── reports/                 # Directory for test reports and screenshots
└── package.json             # Project dependencies and scripts
```

Each test file contains a series of test cases that interact with the MyBillBook application through Playwright's API.

## Report Generation

After tests are executed, detailed reports are generated. These reports include:

- **Test Execution Results**: Pass/fail status for each test case.
- **Execution Time**: Time taken to run each test.
- **Screenshots/Video**: Captured for failed tests.

Reports can be found in the `reports/` directory. If you are using **Allure**, you can generate and view the reports as follows:

1. Install Allure globally (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   npm install -g allure-commandline
   ```

2. Generate the Allure report:

   ```bash
   allure serve reports/allure-results
   ```

This will open the Allure report in your browser.
